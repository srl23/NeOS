# NeOS
Neon OS will be a project I work on in my own time where I teach myself how to build a fully working, even if basic, operating system. I intend on it supporting things such as: multi-threading, hardware accelerated graphics, multi-user, networking, virtual memory mapping, and support for multiple file partitions. I don't have much of this knowledge right now, but my goal is to work towards this bit by bit.

I will be using the Bare Bones guide to begin the process and slowly fill it out with the planned features one by one.
